# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

This is a project that entails validating syntax from a user input. The requirement was to use Javascript to validate whether a string from a user
follows the right syntax. This was done by using string manipulation methods and logic to determine the validity of the input string.
The result of the validation is displaye to the user after they submit their input string.

## Reflection and challenges:<br>
For this project, I found it challenging to validate the last part of the string as initially I could only validate the first 14 characters of the name of the pet. 
I realised this is not a robust solution as a pet name could have any number of characters. But after consulting with peers, I found a robust solution that caters for any length of the name of the pet. Overall, it was a fun project and I enjoyed it and learnt new things.
